  <h1>🌞 My Daily Routine</h1>

  <h2>📋 Things I Do Daily</h2>

  <p>
    Every day, I follow a consistent routine to stay focused, healthy, and productive.
    My mornings start with light exercise or a walk to energize myself. After that, I enjoy a healthy breakfast
    and spend some time learning — often reading articles, practicing HTML or SQL, or watching tutorials.
    <br><br>
    During the day, I focus on project work — coding, solving problems, and exploring new technologies.
    I regularly update my progress on GitHub to track my growth.
    <br><br>
    In the evening, I relax with family, reflect on the day, and prepare for tomorrow. This routine keeps me balanced and motivated.
